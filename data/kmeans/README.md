# Figure 1

## x.npy and y.npy
The x and y values for the entire data set that is being clustered for this section.

## trad_x.npy and trad_y.npy
The x and y values for the centroids of the three snapshots I wanted to include in the paper. These correspond to Figures 1a-c.

## const_x.npy and const_y.npy
Final ending point of k-means with constrained clusters for a sample run. This is the same as Figure 1d.

## furthest.npy
Results of dissimilarity matrix (with no clustering). This is the same as Figure 1e.

## far_constx.npy and far_consty.npy
Result of using the dissimilarity matrix OP's as the starting centroids for clustering. This is the same as Figure 1f.
