Outside of Paper
free energy plot
rc val over trajectory (unbiased and biased)
resubmit unbiased and biased runs for fkbp/but
make good image of fkbp/but system
dissimilarity matrix heat plot
calculate other run data


In Paper
change figures to tables where possible
refer to algorithm number instead of dissimilarity matrix construction and clustering
keep upper or lower case on dissimilarity and matrix consistent
update aladip references to be cut completely
mention full form of BUT like [they] did in praminik, smith, et all JPCB
cite below link for delta g for fkbp/but

cite below and say amino+sgoop+metadynamics could be futher complemented by funnel metadynamics to speed up re-entry
